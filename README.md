# Smart-Health-Monitoring-System
The smart health monitoring system is a system which 
measures the body health parameters and displays it in a webpage 
and in the Blynk app through which the doctors/patient responders 
can check the status of the patient. 
It also gives alerts to the doctors/patient responders when the health parameters 
cross a certain threshold and sends the patientâ€™s data to the cloud platform and performs data analytics.
